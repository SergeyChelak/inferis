## Overview
Welcome to the FPS Game Research Project! This project is a deep dive into the world of game development, focusing on creating a first-person shooter (FPS) game. The primary goal is not to produce a market-ready game but to explore and understand the various aspects of game development.

## Purpose
The main purposes of this project are:
- To gain hands-on experience with game development.
- To experiment with the Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture.
- To implement a basic game engine from scratch.

## Disclaimer
This project is purely for research and educational purposes. It is not intended to result in a fully-fledged game, and it is not expected that anyone will use it seriously as a game. The focus is on learning and experimentation rather than producing a finished product.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Whether it's suggesting new features, reporting bugs, or improving the documentation, your input is valuable.
