# Inferis

## About
- Inferis is a latin word meaning *hell*. I found that Latin is a good source to obtain an unique name for the Wolfenstein/Doom-like first person shooter game.<br>
- Game architecture is based on ECS approach.<br>
- For video rendering used ray-casting technique like in original Wolfenstein/Doom by id Software.
